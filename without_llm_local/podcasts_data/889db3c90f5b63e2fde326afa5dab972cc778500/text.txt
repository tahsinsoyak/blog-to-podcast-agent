BART (large-sized model), fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail

BART model pre-trained on English language, and fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail. It was introduced in the paper BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension by Lewis et al. and first released in [this repository (https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart).

Disclaimer: The team releasing BART did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

Model description

BART is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. BART is pre-trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text.

BART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering). This particular checkpoint has been fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail, a large collection of text-summary pairs.

Intended uses & limitations

You can use this model for text summarization.

How to use

Here is how to use this model with the pipeline API:

from transformers import pipeline summarizer = pipeline( "summarization" , model= "facebook/bart-large-cnn" ) ARTICLE = """ New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband. Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a ...
